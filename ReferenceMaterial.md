# Introduction
The goal of this project is to learn more about SURF object identification in an image.
I'd like to see how this works on different types of track images.

I learned about this video after I had things working. However, I think it would have been helpful to see how CMAKE_GUI can be used to build C++ libraries for C++ rather than Java.
